Differential abundance of cells on UMAP (milo)

fraction of an indivudual in each cell type
Done

Make script to prove differential expression genes between ALS/Healthy by shuffle
Done but does not solve the issue

check for PCs which can discriminate between ALS/control (logistic regression)
Done

Show different subgrouops
separate ALS/Control
Try to highlight difference between treatment and control (D7 vs D14)
Features associated with disease  (transcription or diff efficiency)

individuals might have trajectory differences (maybe can be associated with genotype)

Functional enrichment of C2 genes did not reach statistical significance
SOD1
D14 less mMN because they died? Hard to draw conclusions because did not check for dead cells?

Send gender to sanity check.
